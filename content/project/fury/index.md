title: FURY Tutorials
summary: FURY is an open-source scientific visualization library for Python, created and written by the Garyfallidis Research Group at Indiana's School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering, for which I interened this past summer of 2020. As a part of the GRG team, I worked to add several new features to FURY, including new prisms and functions, as well as write tutorials for new users of FURY to familiarize with the library's capabilities. I wrote several tutorials for FURY's official site, which taught users how to add textures to sphere objects, how to create simple animations involving several sphere actors, how to animate the solar system, and how to create sphere actors on a globe textured sphere to align with the coordinates of a specific place.

![Solar System Visualization Tutorial](solarsystem.jpg)
This is a screenshot of one of the tutorials that I wrote for FURY, which taught users how to create and texture sphere objects corresponding to each of the planets in our solar system, and animate each of them to follow a scaled orbital path relative to their actual orbit in space, resulting in a product that visualizes each of the planets orbitting and rotating at their respective speeds.
